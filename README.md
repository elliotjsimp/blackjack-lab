# Blackjack Lab: Play, Simulate, Learn  

Blackjack Lab is a project designed to provide three core functionalities around the game of Blackjack:  

---

## Play
- Play Blackjack sessions with or without additional (simulated) players, against a dealer.  
- Practice strategies or simply play for testing and experimentation.  

---

## Simulate
- Run large-scale simulations of Blackjack sessions, with configurable numbers of players and rounds.  
- Define and test your own strategies under realistic conditions.  
- *(Planned)*: Add visualization tools to better understand simulation results.  

---

## Learn
- Study Blackjack fundamentals, including “Basic Strategy” and card counting.  
- *(Planned)*: Documentation and guides to explain concepts in detail.  

---

### Notes  
- This project simulates each card and deck individually.  
- The shoe is modeled with a 6-deck capacity and a 75% penetration marker for realistic play.  
- Optionally, a Continuous Shuffle Machine can be enabled to remove all player advantage.
